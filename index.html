  <p>The use of electronic digital text (E-text) is a convenient and popular method of disseminating information in print formats on the web.
If the document is not readily available in any electronic form, it can be converted to e-text by using an optical character reader and a scanner to create an electronic version and then proofread and edited to eliminate scanning errors. This can be a time-consuming process, especially for longer documents.
There are many advantages to the use of E-text. The main advantage of E-text is that it can be easily stored, can be searched and indexed, and can be converted to large print or hard copy Braille through use of a translation program.
E-text can also be used with screen reading software to output the text to a speech synthesizer or refreshable Braille display and partially sighted individuals can use E-text by taking advantage of built-in options within many standard software applications (e.g. adjusting font size) or through the use of specialized screen magnification software.
    But to be useful as a method of providing accessibility, E-text must be appropriately formatted.</p>

  <p>Plain E-text (usually known as ASCII or DOS text) is the universal standard for exchange of text documents and can be used by almost any word processing program. Such files typically have a ".txt" extension.
One drawback to the use of plain “.txt” E-text is that most formatting (tables, columns, headers, tabs, bold, italic, etc.) will be lost.
In some instances it is possible to avoid losing the documents’ format by using files in other common formats such as Microsoft Word 6 or above (“.doc”) or rich text format (".rtf").
There are also a variety of proprietary file formats that cannot be used by screen reading software.
For example, documents produced by many sophisticated page layout and design programs (i.e., FrameMaker, QuarkExpress, PageMaker) or documents saved in Portable Document Format (PDF), cannot be directly used with screen readers. In such cases, it will be necessary to convert the file into a format that is accessible.
E-text in proprietary formats used by publishers or manufacturers of electronic digital text may contain cryptic formatting for security purposes or may have been converted to E-text using an image transfer application (“.tiff”). If the text requires a proprietary viewer, it may be difficult or impossible to convert the file into a useable format.</p>
